The dataset in the folder is already processed. Therefore, the processing.py file code doesnt serve any function. It is simply there to show the steps taken to process the data.

Steps to run our model:

1. Select the file which contains the training model you want to test (linear_regression.py/ridge_regression.py/support_vector_classification.py).
2. Run the file.

NOTE** Running processing.py will not work as we have only included our final dataset so it will be not be able to run code that opens our initial datasets.
